This project, titled “Data Sorter – Sorting Algorithm Comparison Tool,” was developed for the CIT300 – Data Structures and Algorithms module. The system is a Java-based console application designed to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms — Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. It allows users to manually input numbers or generate random datasets, perform sorting, and view the execution time and number of steps taken by each algorithm. A comparison table summarizes the performance results, highlighting the impact of algorithmic complexity on sorting efficiency.

The project was collaboratively developed by B.G. Amanda Kaushali (22UG3-0709), K.H. Ishini Pawanya Daluwatta (22UG3-0513), L. Thamindu Nayanajith (22UG3-0001), and H.G. Maheeshi Kawshani (22UG3-0442), with each member responsible for implementing and integrating specific components. This group assignment demonstrates teamwork, algorithm analysis, and performance evaluation using Java and GitHub collaboration.
